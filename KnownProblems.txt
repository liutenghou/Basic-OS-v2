Output should be:
create inited
RootPID:1, P1PID:3, P2PID:4, P3PID:5, P4PID:6
Process:1 (root) alive
Process:3 alive
Process:4 alive
Process:5 alive

Process:3 sleep1 done, slept:1000 ms exit
Process:4 sleep1 done, slept:2000 ms exit

Process:6 sleep1 done, slept:4000 ms exit
kernel: done sleep
Process:5 message received sleep for: 10000 ms
Process:4 message received sleep for: 7000 ms

Process:5 sleep2 done, slept:10000 ms exit
Process:3 sleep2 done, slept:20000 ms exit
Process:6 sleep2 done, slept:27000 ms exit

However, the times that the output is displayed can vary sometimes, with
the 7000 sleep taking longer sometimes.

1) We assume that rootPID is 1 

2) receive call in root process is not yielding properly, not sure why.
